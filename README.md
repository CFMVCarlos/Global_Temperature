Global_Temperature by CFMVCarlos

A program that request a map from MapBox and weather from OpenWeatherMap and displays the current temperature in a canvas.

First, you will need to register to MapBox in https://www.mapbox.com/. After you created an account, go to "Account" under your profile and there you will find how togenerate an access token. Copy and paste it to secret.json file.
Secondly, go to https://openweathermap.org/ and sign in. After that, in the home page, you will find an "API keys" tab where you need to click to access the API key that you will need. Once again, copy and paste it to secret.json file.

Now that you have the API codes working, simply run the code. You will have an INPUT box to type in the cities to receive the Weather Data and a BUTTON to freeze/unfreeze the cities you typed in.

If you find any error or an improvement, feel free to pull-request.
